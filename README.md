## Analysis and Conclusions
Based on the analysis of student performance in 15 schools, we have come to several conclusions that challenge conventional wisdom about education.

First, it is counterintuitive that the higher the investment per student, the lower the overall passing rate. Our data shows that how the money is applied is more important than how much is invested in education. This indicates that schools need to be strategic in how they allocate their resources to optimize student performance.

Secondly, the size of schools is a crucial factor that affects the overall passing rate. Our data shows that large schools have a significantly lower rate of overall passing (58.3%) than medium (90.6%) and small (89.9%) schools. This suggests that small and medium-sized schools may be better equipped to provide personalized attention to students, which is necessary for their academic success.

Finally, our analysis shows that charter schools have a significantly higher overall passing rate (90.4%) than district schools (53.7%). This provides compelling evidence that personalized teaching approaches are favorable for children's performance in school. Charter schools have greater flexibility in designing their curriculum and hiring teachers, allowing them to provide a more personalized approach that can better cater to individual student needs.

In conclusion, our analysis highlights the importance of resource allocation, school size, and personalized teaching approaches in improving student performance. Schools need to carefully consider how they allocate their resources and design their teaching approaches to ensure that students receive the support they need to succeed academically.
